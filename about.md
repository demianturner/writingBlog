I started programming in around 2000, before that I trained and worked in the visual arts, and eventually graphic design.  Since entering the world of text, programming was never easy for me, but eventually I got a handle on it and it became very satisfying to do well in something that  initially appeared quite difficult.

At around the the same time I began writing a lot more.  Initially it was mostly for work, creating documentation for large and complex projects.  How to create and search the documents was an interesting technical challenge so around that time I began investigating which software options were available.

Dealing with any large text corpus you face similar challenges:
- how to impose order on the data with classification
- achieving meaningful search results
- managing distributed access and permissions
- data redundancy 

Working on large software projects involves the same concerns:
- managing complexity
- dealing with change and versioning
- in a 150k LOC codebase a stray comma/white space can derail everything 

While I was learning about programming I enjoyed keeping a blog, before I knew it I had 10 yearâ€™s worth of entries and a lot of readers.  Complexity mounted as I was faced with maintaining so much content.

My interest in writing grew and I diverged into more personal content, keeping journals and writing observations, as well as collecting insights plucked from around the web.

One theme has emerged over the years, I feel I am often standing up against a huge wall of text and am involved in various battles with it.  Whether programming or personal writing, it takes a lot of work to tame a bunch of text and transform it into something coherent and useful, maybe even beautiful.  Almost invariably software tools are used as part of the transformation process, and more often than not they are sub-par.

Probably the most surprising outcome of the increased energy invested in personal writing over the last 5 years is to find an improvement in my critical thinking.
