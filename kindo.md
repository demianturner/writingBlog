## CTO, London. 2007 - 2008

Kindo was a social genealogy startup with users in 150+ countries built by an international team.  Our app was translated into 17 languages.
 
I co-founded the social network with 3 colleagues in early 2007. It was a VC-backed startup that enabled families to keep in touch and provided an means for members to discover new relatives as well as catch up with old ones.
 
In my role as CTO I recruited a tight-knit team of talented developers and managed the technical design and development of a sophisticated social network application. The data modelling was a complex undertaking given the complex relationships expressed in genealogical graphs.
 
Kindo allowed you to build your family tree in minutes using the intuitive GUI you could add relatives and invite them to join your tree by email, or import contacts from any web-based email provider. The activity stream kept users posted of whoâ€™d done what in the family, which invitations were sent, and provided updates for birthdays, anniversaries and status messages. The photo album made it easy to share photos with family. The profile tools allowed users to build detailed information about themselves and their past, providing a means for family members to get to know each other better. The network was integrated with context-sensitive gift suggestions, and family members were alerted when an upcoming birthday or anniversary was approaching.
 
While building Kindo my team met with a number of considerable challenges which we took in our stride, in many cases pushing web techniques beyond established boundaries in order to solve problems elegantly. One such example was the Flash/Javascript/Ajax tree builder GUI at the heart of Kindo, recognised by many as being the best of its kind amongst industry competitors like Verwandt, Geni and Genoom.
