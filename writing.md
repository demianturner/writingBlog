# Tools and Techniques for Overcoming Writing Challenges

## Introduction
This is a project about dealing with text.  I like to think of text in its raw form, as an [encoding of language][1], a representation of our knowledge, memories and experience frozen in a concrete form, a snapshot in time.  We have a seemingly unlimited capacity for experience and it’s great that a technique exists that allows us to capture and explore it.  Our accumulated experience is vast, but more vast still is our capacity to investigate and distill key moments and insights.  Writing is one tool available to facilitate such practice.

## Recording
Given that there is so much to write about, the question arises, how can we encode such a great volume of material effectively with writing?  One approach is to attack the problem one piece at a time, writing about and exploring themes as they arise and collecting them in a single place.  Then we must ask how do we link the related content and review it for further refinement.  We watch so many films that move us, read books that inspire us and see things online that make an indelible impression - all [candidates for preservation][2]. 

## Organising
First we need to find the appropriate software.  In 2016 it is a given that the obvious tool to preserve a vast archive of data is a computer, so the more difficult question is [which software to use][3].  As we trundle through our lives, over the years it’s natural that our writing will be scattered all over the place, in various files, maybe on various computers, sometimes lost, in most cases difficult to access.  What if all our writing was available at our fingertips, easily searchable and in a uniform and accessible format.  That is the goal of this project, to turn a [bunch of text][4] into a coherent whole.  When faced with such a volume of disparate data we need to define some objectives the completion of which would indicate a successful outcome.  I propose the following:
- to collect all the text in a single, addressable space (let’s say one computer)
- to transform the text into a [common format][5] 
- to establish links between the entries with a view to imposing order

For the repository of text to be orderly, however, is not necessarily an urgent priority.  Indeed, followers of the [Zettelkasten technique][6] would argue that some degree of chaos in the archive is beneficial  will lead to serendipitous discoveries.

## Publishing
When a coherent piece of writing has been produced, part of the refinement process is sharing our work with the world: [publishing]().  The feedback and insight we gain from sharing our work with others is invaluable.  We live in an age where this is easier than ever before.  However incorporating publishing into an effective writing workflow is in fact deceptively tricky.

## Challenges
There are many challenges that the writer will face along the way.  When we write some content it’s useful to think of which of the [types of writing][8] it falls into, as this will help us to better structure the design of our archive.  Better understanding which kind of writing we are doing will help us choose the [appropriate software][9] to manage the work.  Once we have made a good choice and found an appropriate tool, we then face three types of challenges:
- [technical challenges][10]
- [productivity challenges][11] 
- intellectual challenges (content related)

I would argue that once the first two barriers are overcome the third one solves itself through experience.  So the productivity point is an important one.  In order to create and collect a critical mass of text we need to be proficient in [productivity techniques][12] so that we can be writing and reviewing our work on a regular basis.  Text revision is also an important point.  Because it is easy to fire and forget, i.e. write something and never read it again, or just plain lose our work, it’s worth discussing different techniques for [effectively reviewing][13] and enhancing the text corpus.  

A final challenge must be understood in order to be productive is how to deal with [information overload][14], the hidden blight of our age.

## Conclusion
I’ve enjoyed researching these various aspects of writing and productivity, coming up with solutions and hope the tools and techniques discussed herein help you in some way on your writing journey.
